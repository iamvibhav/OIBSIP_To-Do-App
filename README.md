# Todo App

This Todo App is a project developed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. It is designed to help users organize their tasks efficiently, prioritize activities, and boost productivity. The app provides a sleek and intuitive interface for managing tasks, with both backend and frontend components implemented to ensure a seamless user experience.
